abstract = {Background: Sports coaching is largely a social activity where engagement with athletes and support staff can enhance the experiences for all involved. This paper examines how high performance football coaches develop knowledge through their interactions with others within a social learning theory framework. Purpose: The key purpose of this study was to explore how coaches interact with others in developing their coaching knowledge within the Australian Football (soccer) context. Moreover, this project examined how to best conceptualise these interactions using social learning concepts such as communities of practice (Wenger 1998), informal knowledge networks (Allee 2000), networks of practice (Nichani and Hung 2002) and dynamic social networks (Mallett, Rossi, and Tinning 2007). Method: Six high performance football coaches were interviewed using a semi-structured schedule. The interview data, which was transcribed verbatim, was content analysed using the procedure outlined by Côté et al. (1993). Results: From the interviews three themes emerged: influence of others on learning; learning through work and play; and elite football identity. These themes were examined under the lens of social learning theory. Conclusions: The coaches in this study reported that they considered ‘coaches of influence’ as their most important source of information. In particular, it was the interactions with experienced football coaches who were most valued. In these interactions ideas and views about football coaching were exchanged and are best represented as a dynamic social network.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use the results of an exploratory case study to discuss the design and delivery of formal coach education pathways. Nine coaches completed qualitative and quantitative feedback on a formal transformational leadership training program. The theme that was consistently being presented by coaches was the need for learning to be situated within practical demonstrations and discussions where the coach learner and coach educator work collaboratively to facilitate understanding of the applications of program content to coaching practice. These results have been discussed in the light of the parallel processes that are evident in coach education. The relationship dynamics between athlete and coach are paralleled in the relationship between coach learner and coach educator. Formalising the parallel process in coach education is put forward as a conceptually sound approach to facilitate reflection in coaching practitioners through the use of practical demonstrations.},

abstract = {A recent development in large-scale coach accreditation (certification) structures has been the ‘fast tracking’ of former elite athletes. Former elite athletes are often exempted from entry-level qualifications and are generally granted access to fast track courses that are shortened versions of the accreditation courses undertaken by ‘traditional path’ coaches. While formal coach accreditation is not the focus of this research note, it does provide the context for the two coaching case studies. The aim of this article is to consider and contrast the experiences of a former elite athlete and a traditional pathway coach with respect to their development and their trajectory towards employment in high performance coaching settings. The notion of relational interdependence (Billett, 2006) is used to consider the characteristics that particular coaches may bring to their work. In examining the social nature of coaching work and coaching appointments further, it is possible to connect with the notion of social capital (Field, 2006). Informed by accreditation course information (coaching history, aspirations and educational achievements) and three days of in-course observations by the author, the interpretivist case study design incorporated a semi-structured interview with one former elite athlete and one traditional pathway coach during the top level coach accreditation course of one of Australia's most popular team sports. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded via a hierarchical content analysis. From this study it was possible to identify a range of affordances that are available to former elite athletes that are not readily accessible for traditional pathway coaches and vice versa. Regarding social capital, former athletes appear to possess greater amounts and are better able to leverage that capital for development and employment. Recommendations are offered and implications discussed for coaches and those individuals and organisations charged with employing high performance coaches.},

abstract = {Background: Research on coach development and knowledge acquisition has traditionally focused on those working at either university or Olympic levels. Despite the large body of research using these participants, there are relatively few empirical studies on the knowledge development of high school coaches, in particular, physical education teachers/coaches. This is unfortunate since it is equally important to examine aspects of high school coaches' knowledge and how these coaches acquired their knowledge given the impact a high school coach may have on young athletes' development and overall sport experience. Purpose: To investigate sources of knowledge acquisition of Canadian high school team sport coaches. Participants and setting: Six high school team sport coaches from the same school board, residing in a major urban Canadian city, participated in this study. Each participant was teaching full-time physical education and coaching at least two different sports and a minimum of two teams. Coaches represented a variety of team sports. Research design: A qualitative research design using a semi-structured open-ended interview format was employed in the current study. Key questions were based on Côté, Salmela, Trudel, Baria and Russell's Coaching Model from 1995 and related coaching science literature. Data collection: Two physical education consultants and a university physical education pedagogy Professor identified candidates for the current study. Participants were contacted by email or telephone, informed of the nature of the study and asked to participate. Following this, each participant was asked to complete a consent form in accordance with the university ethics policy, as well as a demographic questionnaire. The coaches were interviewed individually for a period of time varying from one to two hours at a mutually convenient location. Data analysis: The main objective of the data analysis was to create a system of emerging categories that adequately described the sources of knowledge acquisition of high school team sport coaches. Three categories emerged with an inductive analysis of the data. Findings: Results revealed that while each coach's journey was unique, their knowledge acquisition was similar in many ways. Initially, their formal education provided them with training in sport sciences and physical education pedagogy, as well as practical coaching experiences. Their knowledge base was further developed once they began working in high school, interacting with more experienced coaches, and acquiring additional information through coaching clinics, books, and the internet. Conclusions: Given that knowledge was acquired from a variety of sources, it can be concluded that high school coaches learn from a combination of formal training, informal learning opportunities, and practical experiences to prepare them to work in their domain.},

abstract = {Researchers have investigated how elite or expert coaches learn to coach, but very few have investigated this process with coaches at the recreational or developmental-performance levels. Thirty-six youth-sport coaches (ice hockey, soccer, and baseball) were each interviewed twice to document their learning situations. Results indicate that (a) formal programs are only one of the many opportunities to learn how to coach; (b) coaches’ prior experiences as players, assistant coaches, or instructors provide them with some sport-specific knowledge and allow them to initiate socialization within the subculture of their respective sports; (c) coaches rarely interact with rival coaches; and (d) there are differences in coaches’ learning situations between sports. Reflections on who could help coaches get the most out of their learning situations are provided. In an attempt to prepare coaches for their important role in sport settings, many countries have developed their own coach-education or -certification programs. The national representative bodies or international federations in these countries can now join the International Council for Coach Education, which “believes that international collaboration and exchange can accelerate positive change in the realm of coaching development and help these coaches give athletes around the world a chance to pursue excellence” (www.icce.ws). Researchers have recently investigated how elite or expert 1 coaches develop their knowledge. Using interviews, Fleurance and Cotteaux (1999) studied 10 coaches from different disciplines in France; Irwin, Hanton, and Kerwin (2004) looked at 16 gymnastics coaches in England; Jones, Armour, and Potrac (2004) interviewed 8 coaches from different sports in England, Australia, and New Zealand; Salmela (1996) studied 22 coaches from team sports in Canada; and Gould, Giannini, Krane, and Hodge (1990) surveyed 130 coaches in the United States. A common finding in these studies is the disparity among the coaches as to the perceived importance of formal coach-education programs in their development of knowledge. There is an agreement, however, that other learning opportunities that stem from playing experience, mentoring, and discussions with foreign coaches play a significant role. The perceived importance of each of these less formal learning situations varies from coach to coach. Overall, these studies have shown that learning to coach at the elite level is a complex process that does not follow one specific pattern, and, therefore, coach education should not},

So far, there has been little evidence to suggest that coaches rely on sport scientists for their information, which would indicate minimal interaction between sport scientists and coaches. The purpose of this study was to determine the type and source of new ideas that high-performance coaches use to understand the extent to which sport science is the source of those ideas. This project utilized a single case study design involving a group of 20 high-performance coaches in 12 different sports in a university environment, which one would expect to be conducive to interaction between sport scientists and coaches. The method included the administration of a questionnaire, followed by a structured personal interview. Our findings suggest that these coaches do believe that sport science can contribute to coaching, are interested in having a sport scientist work with them, and are motivated to find and implement new ideas in their sport programs. Despite this, most of the respondents indicated they usually get those new ideas from other coaches, or from coaching clinics and seminars, and not from sport scientists or their written work. Reasons stated included a lack of time to look for new ideas and hence the use of expedient sources, and a lack of interest in academic publications.},

Using the work of Pierre Bourdieu, this paper attempts to understand how the “art of coaching” can be characterized as structured improvisation and how experience is crucial to structuring coaching practice. An examination of current coach education and assessment demonstrates that coaching practice viewed as a composite of knowledge has not specifically addressed the pervasive influence of experience on coaching practice. Drawing on experiences from the educational field, we examine how coach education and continuing professional development can utilize mentoring and critical reflection to situate learning in the practical experience of coaching.},

Learning by doing, interaction with coaching peers, and formal coach education were the top actual sources of coaching knowledge. Discrepancies were found between actual and preferred usage of learning by doing, formal coach education, and mentoring. Coaches indicated they would prefer more guided learning and less self-directed learning by doing. Further, differences in preferred sources were identified between coaches wishing to move to an elite level versus coaches wishing to stay at a developmental level. Findings highlight the importance of both experiential and formally guided sources of coaching knowledge and the context-specific nature of coach learning.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Given the turbulent and highly contested environment in which professional coaches work, a prime concern to coach developers is how coaches learn their craft. Understanding the learning and development of senior coaches (SCs) and assistant coaches (ACs) in the Australian Football League (AFL – the peak organisation for Australian Rules Football) is important to better develop the next generation of performance coaches. Hence the focus of this research was to examine the learning of SC and AC in the AFL. Fundamental to this research was an understanding that the AFL and each club within the league be regarded as learning organisations and workplaces with their own learning cultures where learning takes place. The purpose of this paper was to examine the learning culture for AFL coaches. Method: Five SCs, 6 ACs, and 5 administrators (4 of whom were former coaches) at 11 of the 16 AFL clubs were recruited for the research project. First, demographic data were collected for each participant (e.g. age, playing and coaching experience, development and coach development activities). Second, all participants were involved in one semi-structured interview of between 45 and 90 minutes duration. An interpretative (hierarchical content) analysis of the interview data was conducted to identify key emergent themes. Results: Learning was central to AFL coaches becoming a SC. Nevertheless, coaches reported a sense of isolation and a lack of support in developing their craft within their particular learning culture. These coaches developed a unique dynamic social network (DSN) that involved episodic contact with a number of respected confidantes often from diverse fields (used here in the Bourdieuian sense) in developing their coaching craft. Although there were some opportunities in their workplace, much of their learning was unmediated by others, underscoring the importance of their agentic engagement in limited workplace affordances. Conclusion: The variety of people accessed for the purposes of learning (often beyond the immediate workplace) and the long time taken to establish networks of supporters meant that a new way of describing the social networks of AFL coaches was needed; DSN. However, despite the acknowledged utility of learning from others, all coaches reported some sense of isolation in their learning. The sense of isolation brought about by professional volatility in high-performance Australian Football offers an alternative view on Hodkinson, Biesta and James' attempt in overcoming dualisms in learning.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyse Portuguese coaches' perceptions of, and preferences for, knowledge sources as related to professional background; namely academic education level, coach education level and coaching experience. The study's participants comprised 336 Portuguese coaches from twenty-two sports. A questionnaire was used to identify coaches' demographic characteristics and representations about their preferred sources of coaching knowledge. MANOVA using Tukey's HSD test was used to compare groups. The results highlighted that coaches perceived that coaching knowledge is built from a broad range of sources from personal coaching and playing experiences to more explicit formal, informal and non-formal learning situations. Results indicated that the coaches ascribed more importance to experiential sources such as working with experts, learning by doing, interacting with peer coaches and attending informal seminars and clinics, than to the formal learning situations provided by the national coaching certification programs. Differences, however, were found in that coaches who had a greater background within higher education (physical) and sport valued informal and non-formal learning sources more than did coaches who were defined as not coming from an academic background. The findings point to the importance of developing new learning, experientially-based, opportunities within the Portuguese context, where curricula content continues to be delivered via didactic means. Key pointsCoaches recognized that learning is obtained from a broad range of sources of coaching knowledge and each source has a particular role in the development of a coach.Experiential guided sources reached more importance to coaches as working with experts, learning by doing, attending seminars/clinics outside of the formal system and interaction with peers were the most acknowledged.The only source that is related to formal learning, national certification programs, was recognized as the less importance than all informal and non-formal learning situations.The profile of the source of coaching knowledge showed to be stable among coaches as only the academic education level differentiated the coaches' perceptions.},

abstract = {Background: There are approximately 52,000 teacher-coaches coaching 750,000 high school student-athletes in Canada. Despite this large population, Canadian high school teacher-coaches remain relatively unstudied. High school coaches in Canada are often asked to coach sports with which they are unfamiliar, and because they are not required to obtain formal training, they acquire knowledge from various situations in order to meet their learning needs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand how high school teacher-coaches learn to coach, using Jarvis' theory of human learning. Participants and setting: Thirty-one high school teacher-coaches (15 females and 16 males) from 17 schools (12 urban and 5 rural) in Ontario, Canada, participated in this study. All the participants had a minimum of one season of experience as the head coach of a high school sport team. Any sport offered by the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations at any level (midget, junior, or senior) was an acceptable fulfilment of this requirement. Data collection: The participants were interviewed in person at mutually convenient time and location. Interviews ranged from 30 to 75 minutes. Two focus groups, with three participants each, were conducted in two separate schools. Focus groups were conducted during lunch or after school hours at the participants' school. Data analysis: Interviews and focus groups were transcribed verbatim amassing 464 single-spaced pages of data. A theoretically driven thematic analysis was conducted and the data were coded under three main headings: formal, non-formal, and informal learning situations, and further coded using concepts from Jarvis' theory of human learning. All of the coded data were re-read and sorted into potential themes and relationships between themes and codes were identified. Findings: Results indicated that a large number of teacher-coaches had formal coach training, despite it not being mandatory. However, their appreciation of this learning situation was tempered by their biographies. Coaching clinics were viewed as an occasion to develop sport-specific competencies, especially when coaching a sport in which coaches had limited knowledge. Informal learning situations, such as past coaching and/or playing experience, were two life experiences regarded as useful for learning to coach. Interaction with colleagues was utilised by all the participants as a means of developing coaching knowledge. Lack of time was a major factor influencing the type of situations from which teacher-coaches chose to learn. Conclusions: Tailoring coach learning resources to teacher-coaches' needs and schedules would help improve their coaching competencies and ultimately maximise the benefits of high school sport for all involved.},

abstract = {The research on coach learning and development deals with the classification of the sources from which coaches learn, and more recently, with the identification of learning being an idiosyncratic process in which there are variations in coaches’ learning paths. From a constructivist view, learning may be seen as a process of becoming: a person engages in social situations throughout life that are transformed cognitively, emotively and/or practically, and integrated into the person’s biography so that the person becomes more experienced. ‘Episodic experiences’, when they are meaningful to individuals, may result in considerable change to the way that individuals perceive what they know, and have the potential to influence their perception on future learning. The purpose of this article is to illustrate how such meaningful episodic experiences can have an important influence on an individual coach’s process of becoming an experienced coach. Through the use of non-fictional vignettes, we explore how five Canadian women coaches from various sports learned throughout their long careers in coaching as a result of specific episodic experiences in their lives that they considered meaningful. The five vignettes respectively demonstrate learning from episodic experiences with an athlete, with other coaches, in formal and non-formal education courses, with family, and in taking time out to reflect. Due to their own unique biographies, coaches may perceive certain planned and unplanned experiences as meaningful and the learning that occurs as a result may ultimately influence their career paths. This article adds to the emerging body of literature regarding coach learning and highlights the importance of the various experiences of these female coaches in understanding their development.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: This paper attempts to move the discussion of high-performance coach development from an examination of coaches' volume of experiences towards a consideration of the contribution of the learning experiences that coaches have reported throughout their careers. Furthermore, a discussion of proximal and distal guidance in the development of coaches was investigated. We examined the kinds of learning experiences within the framework of workplace learning and specifically the situated nature of learning and the view that learning occurs through social participation. Method: Nineteen high-performance coaches participated in this study, including 10 scholarship and 9 mentor coaches (MCs). Participants rated a list of 14 developmental activities derived from empirical research on a seven-point Likert scale (0 = not used, 1 = of little value, to 7 = extremely valuable). Each participant coach rated the 14 (guided, unguided) activities in the first two years of their coaching career, middle two years, and final two years. To analyse the data and identify the key trends for both the scholarship and MCs we examined statistical differences between scores for each of the sources the non-parametric Friedman test was used (p < .01). Significant χ2 results were followed up with the Wilcoxon (two-tailed) T-test (p < .05) to identify statistically significant differences between scores at different time intervals. Results: Three key findings emerged from these data: (i) reported increased valuing of a range of developmental experiences over time; (ii) temporal variance in the value of different learning sources at different stages of their careers; and (iii) an acknowledgement of the shift away from an emphasis on proximal learning sources for the MC and the shift towards proximal sources for the scholarship coach.},

Using a retrospective survey, this study quantified the cumulative activities, experiences, and interactions that competitive-stream Canadian track and field coaches experienced in formal coaching education, active coaching experience, mentoring, and former athletic experience domains. Analyses identified critical experiences that discriminated between four incremental skill groups: local club (n = 24), senior club (n = 19), provincial (n =10), and national coaches (n = 18). Results demonstrated that certain measures in each of the domains discriminated between the groups, including years of coaching, interactive hours working with athletes, having more assisting coaches whom one has mentored, and having taken more post-secondary coaching courses. These variables, along with former athletic experience prerequisites, were attached to a preliminary between-group developmental framework.},

Through a consideration of the interaction between what the workplace (SIS) affords the individual and the agency of the individual SIS coaches, it is possible to gain an understanding how high performance sport coaches learn in the workplace. Analysis of data collected by means of semi-structured interviews with a group of coaches (n=6) and administrators (n=6), revealed that coaches learned through a variety of sources both within and outside of (but often influenced by) the SIS. In addition, there were a range of factors such as the working climate and the physical environment that were reported to have an impact on the learning of the coaches (structure). In keeping with Billett's (2006) theorizing, aspects of the individuals' agency (e.g. passion for the sport, drive to be the best) were also found to be critical to the learning in the workplace.},

abstract = {Background: The development of high performance sports coaches has been proposed as a major imperative in the professionalization of sports coaching. Accordingly, an increasing body of research is beginning to address the question of how coaches learn. While this is important work, an understanding of how coaches learn must be underpinned by an understanding of what coaches do. This is not to suggest a return to the behaviouristic accounts of coaching, rather a greater consideration of what tasks entail modern coaching work, especially within the dynamic and evolving vocation of high performance coaching. Purpose: In order to add greater texture to accounts characterising high performance coaching as a highly complex collection of practices, this paper will consider the tasks that full-time coaches at a State Institute of Sport (SIS) perform in their work, with a follow-up account of how they felt they learned (or did not learn) the requisite skills and abilities. Participants and setting: Six full-time, high performance sports coaches (average age = 42 years; range = 30–54 years) with an average of 23 years coaching experience (range = 10–34 years) participated in this study. Six sport administrators varying in level of responsibility and authority also participated. All participants were drawn from an Australian state (provincial) academy/institute of sport. Data collection: Participation was open to all coaches and administrators within the SIS with six coaches and six administrators volunteering prior to commencement. All participants were involved in semi-structured interviews aimed at examining the work of SIS coaches and the perceived sources of learning that coaches accessed throughout their careers. The interviews took an average of 82 minutes to complete (range = 60–110 minutes). Data analysis: The interviews were transcribed verbatim, checked for accuracy and returned to the participants for member checking. An interpretative analysis of the interview data was carried out following procedures outlined by Côté and colleagues. The construction of meaning units was enhanced through the use of a decision-making heuristic developed by Côté and Salmela. Findings: SIS coaches were required to perform a great number of tasks ranging from those relating to direct coaching to those associated with public relations behaviours. Coaches and administrators were also able to identify a range of sources of learning prior to, and during their employment with the SIS. Based on a comparison of work tasks and learning experiences, it was determined that SIS coaches were not well prepared to complete a variety of tasks required of them in the SIS environment. Conclusions: Through an analysis of their previous athletic and coaching experiences it is proposed that the coaches were well-prepared to undertake the tasks that were deemed to be central to their coaching work but were less equipped to undertake a range of other tasks required of them when they were first employed at the SIS.},

abstract = {Background: Large-scale coach education programs have been developed in many countries around the world to help prepare coaches for their important role. Coaches have said that they also learn to coach from experience, starting from when they were young athletes until their current coaching positions. Finally, in the last decade, Internet resources have begun to be promoted as valuable tools for learning. Most of the studies on coaches' development have focused on only one of these three ways of learning how to coach. Purpose: To explore the different learning situations in which youth ice hockey coaches learn to coach. Participants: 35 volunteer youth ice hockey coaches from five minor hockey associations in the province of Ontario, Canada. Data collection: Coaches were interviewed individually using a semi-structured interview guide. The questions asked to coaches were about their learning through formal large-scale coach education programs, their learning experiences outside of these programs starting when they were young athletes until their actual head coaching positions, and their use of the Internet. Data analysis: The first part of the interview consisted of specific questions regarding the number of years coaches had played and/or coached hockey and their level of coaching certification. The answers to these questions were entered directly on a form and entered later into Microsoft Excel to perform descriptive statistical tests. The second part of the interview involved more in-depth questions regarding what learning opportunities contributed to their development as a coach. Finally, questions were asked regarding how they use the Internet in their coaching. The content of this second part of the interview was transcribed verbatim into Microsoft Word rich text format for further data analysis using Nvivo software (Qualitative Solution Research, 2002). Findings: The results revealed seven different learning situations including (a) large-scale coach education programs, (b) coaching clinics/seminars, (c) formal mentoring, (d) books/videotapes, (e) personal experiences related to sport, family, and work, (f) face-to-face interactions with other coaches, and (g) the Internet. Conclusion: Considering that coaches learn to coach through many learning situations, it would be inappropriate to discriminate against any of these situations, since each situation seems to have a unique role in the development of a coach. Therefore, it may be concluded that coach education should include a combination of all seven learning situations, instead of focusing on one. Future research should concentrate on investigating the complementary potential of these situations and what can be done to make each of these situations more appealing to coaches.},

It has also been noted that high performance coaches are learners by necessity. However, what remains unclear is how coaches’ learning influences their engagement in sustainable practice. This study draws on three cohorts of full-time high performance coaches employed in Olympic and professional sports throughout Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face and were inductively analysed. The results revealed that the coaches were presented with a variety of opportunities to learn, with the most valued sources being ‘learning on the job’, ‘discussions with others’ and ‘experience as athletes’. These unmediated learning opportunities are critiqued along with other mediated opportunities in relation to notions of sustainability. The dominance of unmediated sources of learning meant that sustainable practice was present but was not assured. Sustainable practice is also discussed in relation to the dominant models of high performance athlete development and the demands of coaching work.},

It is analysed using Wenger's [8] community of practice framework. Interviews were conducted with seven participants including the sport leader (technical director), the league manager, and five coaches. The retrospective account of time period 1 (covering four years) portrays how a visionary leader instigated changes in the sport culture to have coaches share knowledge with the common goal of developing all of the league athletes. For example, the coaches were selected for their specific expertise and were given the responsibility for the corresponding players not only on their own team but on all teams in the league. Establishing a co-operative environment in a competitive context required strong leadership and presented challenges including the alignment of all the coaches, parents, and referees. The time period 2 (covering three years), also studied retrospectively, demonstrates that the loss of the visionary leader led to the return to a more traditional, competitive environment. Finally, the time period 3 (covering one year), which was the timeframe when the research project was conducted, shows a willingness to return to the collaborative ways of time period 1, but also the challenges in making this happen without the presence of a strong, visionary leader.},

abstract = {What experiences are needed to become a high-performance coach? The present study addressed this question through structured retrospective quantitative interviews with 10 team- and 9 individual-sport coaches at the Canadian interuniversity-sport level. Minimum amounts of certain experiences were deemed necessary but not sufficient to become a high-performance coach (e.g., playing the sport they now coach and interaction with a mentor coach for all coaches, leadership opportunities as athletes for team-sport coaches only). Although coaches reported varying amounts of these necessary experiences, general stages of high-performance coach development were traced. Findings serve to identify and support potential high-performance coaches and increase the effectiveness of formal coaching-education programs.},

abstract = {Using Coombs and Ahmed's [1] framework of formal, non-formal, and informal learning as the analytical framework, this paper aims to review and conceptually locate literature exploring how sports coaches acquire the knowledge that underpins their professional practice. Furthermore, in an attempt to develop a robust set of accessible terms and concepts this paper identifies, explores and positions various terminologies under the broader heading of coach learning. It was hoped that this conceptual review would not only stimulate discussion and research into coach learning, but that it would also promote the construction of models of how coaches currently learn, as well as models for enhancing coach learning The paper concludes that coaches learn from a wide range of sources, but formalised (i.e., formal and nonformal) learning episodes were found to be relatively low impact endeavours when compared to informal, self-directed modes of learning.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the developmental pathways of high- performance basketball coaches in Singapore. Such information is useful in providing information about appropriate training and development programmes for high-performance coaches. Nine head coaches and assistant coaches from several senior and youth national basketball teams participated in structured retrospective quantitative interviews. All coaches had at least a Level 2 coaching certificate (technical), with Level 3 being the highest standard attainable in Singapore. They were experienced coaches at the developmental level (i.e., school or club team) prior to their current appointment. Results are partially consistent with previous studies that: (1) most of the coaches were competitive athletes before coaching, and (2) coaches had engaged in coaching for at least 10 years prior to coaching at the elite level. All participant coaches played a variety of sports in the early stages of sport participation. They also trained and prepared for structured competition from their early primary school days. Participant coaches also acknowledged the importance of informal and non-formal learning opportunities in enhancing their coaching knowledge and skills. Unique to the Singaporean context were the absence of mentoring, the structure of the sporting system, and the support for coach development through the national sporting organisation. The results are discussed in relation to coach education and coach development.},

abstract = {There has been a marked increase in the number of government-funded, high performance institutes and academies of sport within Australia. Given that these organisations employ significant numbers of full-time performance sport coaches, they may be accurately characterised as workplaces. Performance sport coaches have underscored the importance of experience in developing their coaching skill. However, despite wide acceptance of the view that learning occurs everywhere but to different extents and with different efficiency, and the acknowledgement of current national coach education programs as insufficient, no sport coaching research has focused specifically on sport workplaces as sites for learning. This paper will review the current nature of coach development with a view to examining the interaction between what the workplace (institute/academy) affords the individual and the personal agency of the individual (high performance sports coaches).},

abstract = {Researchers have investigated how coaches, from the recreational to the elite level of coaching, learn to coach. Many different learning situations have been identified in the research, yet the question remains: How is it that one coach's learning path emphasizes certain learning situations as key, and yet another coach's learning path emphasizes quite different situations? Fifteen Canadian Olympic coaches were interviewed to better understand the coaches' idiosyncratic learning-path phenomena. The findings provide an example of: (a) how coaches within a specific and similar context, in this case Olympic level sport, can differ dramatically regarding the importance that common learning situations have played in their development, and (b) how previous learning and experiences influence what coaches choose to pay attention to and therefore choose to learn. The coaches' idiosyncratic learning paths are also discussed in terms of coach development.},
