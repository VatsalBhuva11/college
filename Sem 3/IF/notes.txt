LEC 1
	- Money management: Finance is the systematic and disciplined study of financial transactions of money.

	- Allocation of assets and liabilities: Finance is about the bottom line of business activities; prerequisite for success in business.

	- Financial assets (intangible) include stocks, bonds, and cash, while real assets (tangible assets) are those that have value due to their physical attributes such as real estate, metal, land, infrastructure, and commodities. Assets are the backbone and lifeblood of the economy, enabling us to create wealth. Financial Assets are highly liquid assets that are either in cash or can be fast converted to cash.

	-> Financial System:
		- five components that comprise the financial system: Households, financial intermediaries, non- financial corporations, goods market, and capital markets.
		
	-> Fundamental Challenges of Finance:
		- All business decisions involves two aspects of financial analysis
			I. Valuation of assets
			II. Management of assets
		- Valuation is the starting point for management
		- Once value is established, select the decision that is the most valuable for achieving the objectives
											Decisions + Valuations -> Objectives
		- Asset valuation is the process of determining the fair market or present value of assets
		- To make sound financial decisions, we need to know how to value assets.
		
	- Price discovery is a process which determines market prices, mostly through interactions between buyers and sellers. Price discovery is a method for determining the spot price of a commodity through interactions between sellers and buyers – often referred to as a price discovery process or price discovery mechanism. The spot price is the current price in the marketplace at which a given asset—such as a security, commodity, or currency—can be bought or sold for immediate delivery.

	- They reflect market expectations regarding the future as inferred from currently available information.
										
	-> Valuation of Assets:
		- Each asset is defined by its cash flow (CF). value of the asset = value of its cash flow.
		- Cash flow is the net cash and cash equivalents transferred in and out of a company. Cash received represents inflows, while money spent represents outflows.
		- Important characteristics of a cash flow
				1. Time: time value of money, The time of its revelation
					- Cash flows now are different from cash flows later
					- Time flows in only one direction
					Example. $1,000 today vs. $1,000 next year.
				2. Risk: risk premium, The nature of its randomness
					Example. $1,000 for sure vs. $0 and $2,000 with equal
					odds.
					
	-> Opportunity Cost of Capital:
		- Opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return offered by equivalent investments in financial markets. it is the rate of return that you could earn by investing your money in the best alternative project with similar risk and duration.
		- An investment is an acquisition of an asset: pay cash today, receive cash flow in the future.
		
	- Balance sheet: snapshot of financial status or wealth of a company. it includes the current assets, liabilities, debt, shareholders' equity, fixed assets at that moment.
	  
	- Income statement: tells the sources of funds, and the uses of funds over any time period. How much the company is making per unit time versus its losses.
	
		• The sources of funds originate from:
			– A decrease in liabilities or an increase in assets
			– Net income after tax
			– Proceeds of loans obtained
			– Proceeds of shares that were issued
			– Any increase in net working capital
		• The application of funds includes:
			– The purchase of fixed assets/investments
			– The full or partial payment of loans
			– Granting of loans
			– Liability for taxes
			– Dividends paid or proposed
			– Any decrease in net working capital
			
	
	-> Cash Flow of A Firm:
		- As a corporate financial officer you are focused on cash, the flow of
		cash.
			1. Cash raised from investors (selling financial assets)
			2. Cash invested in real assets (tangible and intangible)
			3. Cash generated by operations
			4. Cash reinvested
			5. Cash returned to investors (debt payments, dividends, etc.)
			
	-> Role of Financial Manager:
		• Management perspective
			– Real Investment: 2, 3
			– Financing: 1, 4
			– Payout: 5
			– Risk management: 1, 5
		• Coordinating with other departments/divisions
		• Dealing with financial markets
		• Forecasting and planning of firms’ financial needs
		
	-> Goal of Financial Management
		- Maximizing shareholder’s wealth
		- Maximize current market value of the firm (as measured by share prices).
		- When business managers try to maximize the wealth of their firm, they are actually trying to increase the company's stock price. As the stock price increases, the value of the firm increases, as well as the shareholders' wealth. 
	
	-> Financial Markets:
		- The Primary Market
			-The primary market is where securities are created. It's in this market that firms sell (float) new stocks and bonds to the public for the first time. An initial public offering, or IPO, is an example of a primary market.

		- The Secondary Market
			-For buying equities, the secondary market is commonly referred to as the "stock market." This includes the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and all major exchanges around the world. The defining characteristic of the secondary market is that investors trade among themselves.
			-That is, in the secondary market, investors trade previously issued securities without the issuing companies' involvement. For example, if you go to buy Amazon (AMZN) stock, you are dealing only with another investor who owns shares in Amazon. Amazon is not directly involved with the transaction.

		- The Money Market
			- The money market is the trade in short-term debt. It is a constant flow of cash between governments, corporations, banks, and financial institutions, borrowing and lending for a term as short as overnight and no longer than a year.
		- The Capital Market
			- The capital market encompasses the trade in both stocks and bonds. These are long-term assets bought by financial institutions, professional brokers, and individual investors.
			
	- the ways in which stocks can be traded are (basically types of secondary market):
		• Organized exchange – most of stocks, bonds and derivatives are traded.
			Has a trading floor where floor traders execute transactions in the
			secondary market for their clients.
			basically proper stock exchanges like nifty-fifty, nasdaq, wallstreet, etc. for listed companies.
		• Over-the-counter (OTC) market- Stocks not listed on the organized
		exchanges are traded in the OTC market.
			– Facilitates secondary market transactions.
			– Unlike the organized exchanges, the OTC market doesn’t have a
			trading floor.
			– The buy and sell orders are completed through a telecommunications
			network.
			- for unlisted companies.
			
		- key differences between OTC and exchanges:
			The difference between OTC and Exchange can be drawn clearly on the following grounds:

			Exchange implies a trade exchange which can be an organization or institution, that hosts a market where stocks of listed companies are traded between the buyers and sellers. On the other hand, OTC expands to over the counter, which refers to a decentralised market, wherein buyers look for sellers and vice versa to communicate with each other by way of computer network or phone.

			In an over the counter market the dealers play the role of market makers, as they quote the price at which the securities and other financial instruments are bought and sold between the participants. Conversely, in case of an exchange, the trading exchange is the market maker, as the prices are determined by the demand and supply forces.

			The companies which do not follow the guidelines and meet the requirements of the exchange often trade their securities OTC, which are generally small companies. As against, big business houses usually go for listing and trading their stocks through an exchange.

			One of the main difference between these two is that an exchange is physically present, wherein the open outcry method is used. In contrast, OTC has no physical location, everything is phone-based or computer-based.

			In an exchange, trading is performed during trading hours only. On the contrary, in OTC, trading is performed 24×7.

			When it comes to transparency, the OTC market is not as transparent as an exchange, where the participants have complete information and knowledge about the securities being traded.	
					
			
	-> Functions of Financial Markets:
		1. Allocating resources:
			• Across time.
			• Example – Borrow money to buy a home.
			• Across different states of economy.
			• Example – Invest in stocks/bonds.
		2. Communicating information.
			• Market prices reflect available information.
			
	-> Forms of Business Organization:
		1) Sole Proprietorship:
			• It is a business owned by a single individual that is entitled to all the firm’s profits and is responsible for all the firm’s debt.
			• There is no separation between the business and the owner when it comes to debts or being sued.
			• Sole proprietorships are generally financed by personal loans from family and friends and business loans from banks.
		
		2) Partnership:
			• A partnership is an association of two or more persons who come together as co-owners for the purpose of operating a business for profit.
			• There is no separation between the partnership and the owners with respect to debts or being sued
			
			i) General Partnership
				- A general partnership comprises two or more owners to run a business. In this partnership, each partner represents the firm with equal right. All partners can participate in management activities, decision making, and have the right to control the business. Similarly, profits, debts, and liabilities are equally shared and divided equally. 
				- Each partner should take full responsibility for the debts and liability incurred by the other partner.
			ii) Limited Partnership
				- this partnership includes both the general and limited partners. The general partner has unlimited liability, manages the business and the other limited partners. Limited partners have limited control over the business (limited to his investment). They are not associated with the everyday operations of the firm.
				- the limited partners only invest and take a profit share. They do not have any interest in participating in management or decision making.
				
			iii) Corporation:
				- “an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in the contemplation of the law.
				- Corporation can individually sue and be sued, purchase, sell or own property, and its personnel are subject to criminal punishment for crimes committed in the name of the corporation
				- Corporation is legally owned by its current stockholders.
				- Double taxation (income taxed at the corporate rate and then dividends taxed at personal rate, while dividends paid are not tax deductible)
				
			iv) Limited liability company (LLC):
				- Limited liability company (LLC) combines the tax benefits of a partnership (no double taxation of earnings) and limited liability benefit of corporation (the owner’s liability is limited to what they invest).
				
	-> The Agency Problem
		• Agency relationship
			– Principal hires an agent to represent its interests
			– Stockholders (principals) hire managers (agents) to run the
		company
		• Agency problems: Conflict of interest between principal and agent
			– Management may put their own interest first.
			– Different stakeholders may have conflicting interests.
			Examples: – Not pursuing risky project for fear of losing jobs,
			stealing, expensive perks.
			Example, a manager might hire another assistant manager to lighten their own workload, but this might not be in the best interests of the shareholders, as it increases their costs.
		• All else equal, agency problems will reduce the firm value.
		

# LEC 2
	• From a business perspective, an asset is a sequence of cashflows
	
	• An asset at every point in time is a different asset.
		Asset_t = {CF_t, CF_t+1, CF_t+2...}
	
	• It's a sequence of cash flows at different points in the future, including the
	present, but not the past.
	
	• Valuing an asset requires valuing a sequence of cashflows
		- Sequences of cashflows are the “basic building blocks” of finance
					Value of Asset_t = V_t{CF_t, CF_t+1, CF_t+2...}
		- Vt is obtained from the market.
		
	-> Time value of money:
		• Money you have in hand now is more valuable than money you receive in
	the future. This is because
			- Individuals prefer current consumption to future consumption
			- Opportunity cost of money.
			- Inflation erodes its buying power
		• This is called the time value of money
		- It is only with respect to reinvestment opportunities of funds received early that future cash flows are taken to be less valuable than the present ones. Funds received today would earn a rate of return which may not be possible in case they are received later.
		- Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. 
		- The value of a sequence of cashflows is simply equal to today's dollars, often called present value.	
		- Net present value (NPV) is used to calculate the current value of a future stream of payments from a company, project, or investment.
		- To calculate NPV, you need to estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows and pick a discount rate equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return. 
		- The discount rate refers to the rate of interest that is applied to future cash flows of an investment to calculate its present value. It is the rate of return that companies or investors expect on their investment.
		- If the NPV of a project or investment is positive, it means its rate of return will be above the discount rate.
		• Implicit assumptions/requirements for net present value calculations
			– Cashflows are known (magnitudes, signs, timing) so there's no
			uncertainty
			– Discount rates are known
			– No frictions in currency conversions
		
	-> Future value:
		if interest rate is r;
			$1 in year 0 = $1 * (1+r) in year 1
			$1 in year 0 = $1 * (1+r)^2 in year 2
			$1 in year 0 = $1 * (1+r)^t in year t
	
	-> Present value:
		if interest rate/discount factor is r percent per year;
			$1/(1+r) in year 0 = $1 in year 1
			$1/(1+r)^2 in year 0 = $1 in year 2
			$1/(1+r)^t in year 0 = $1 in year t;
			
		- so, the present value of an asset (V0 or PV) = CF0 + CF1/(1+r) + CF2/(1+r)^2 + ... (basically the future cash flow values converted to present values and summed up)
		- However, we require many assumptions (perfect markets; assume that interest rates are constant)
		- Risk should be incorporated into r. Where r is ‘opportunity cost of capital’ 		or ‘required rate of return’.
		o- Yu have $1 today and the interest rate is 5%.
		• How much will you have in …
			1 year …
			$1 × 1.05 = $1.05
			2 years …
			$1 × 1.05 × 1.05 = $1.103
			3 years …
			$1 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05 = $1.158
			T years …
			$1 × 1.05 × 1.05 × … × 1.05 = $1.05^T
		• $x today is equivalent to $x*(1+r)^T in T years
		• $x in T years is equivalent to $x / (1+r)^T today		
		
	-> Perpetuity:
		- Perpetuity is a situation where a stream of cash flow payments continues indefinitely or is an annuity with infinite maturity. Perpetuity pays constant cashflow C forever.
					PV = C/(1+r) + C/(1+r)^2 + C/(1+r)^3 + ...
					
					PV = C/r (after calculating GP)
					
		- Perpetuity with growth: 
					PV = C/(1+r) + C(1+g)/(1+r)^2 + C(1+g)^2/(1+r)^3 + ...
					
					PV = C/(r-g) (r>g, cash can not grow at a rate faster than the discount rate)
					
	-> Annuity:
		- An annuity is a security that pays a fixed amount every year for a finite number of years. Annuity pays constant cashflow C for T periods.
		
		- so, an infinite maturity annuity = perpetuity.
					PV = C/(1+r) + C/(1+r)^2 + C/(1+r)^3 + ... C/(1+r)^T
					
					PV = C/r - C/(1+r)^T
			
		- T-period annuity = Perpetuity from t=0 - Perpetuity from t=T
		
		- FV(annuity) = PV(annuity) * (1+r)^T
		
		- Annuity with growth:
					PV = C/(1+r) + C(1+g)/(1+r)^2 + C(1+g)^2/(1+r)^3 + ... + C(1+g)^(T-1)/(1+r)^T
					
					PV = C/(r-g) [1 - ((1+g)/(1+r))^T]
					
		- NOTE: FV = PV * (1+r)^T holds always, even if there is a growth rate as growth rate determines how much the cashflow will grow
		
	-> Compounding:
		- On many investments or loans, interest is credited or charged more often than once a year.
		- Annual Percentage Rate (APR):
			- APR is the yearly rate of interest that an individual must pay on a loan, or that they receive on a deposit account.
			- Annual percentage rate (APR) = Quoted rate
										   = interest per period * number of periods per year
		- APR is the rate stated by the company. if the interest is compounded k times a year, and r is the APR,
		then the per-period rate = r/k.
									Effective annual rate (EAR) = [1 + (r / k )]^k - 1
									
		- as k-> infinity, EAR = e^r - 1.
		
		• Discounting rule
			– Bonds
				• Make semiannual payments, interest compounded semiannually
				Discount semiannual cashflows by APR / 2
			– Mortgages
				• Make monthly payments, interest compounded monthly Discount
				monthly cashflows by APR / 12
		- Always use the EAR when compounding and discounting
		- Due to interest compounding, the EAR is higher than the APR whenever the compounding frequency is higher than once a year. (interest gets compounded, so net interest per year increases).
		- move money forward in time by compounding.
		- move money backward in time by discounting.
		
		if interest is paid k times a year, where APR = r, then future value after n years is:
			FV = PV(1+r/k)^(k.n)
		
		Inflation: Change in real purchasing power of $1 over time
			• Different from time-value of money. The purchasing power of money can	vary over time, irrespective of the time value of money.
			• Time value of money simply says that people are impatient and they prefer money now to money later.
			• But inflation is a comment about the purchasing power of that dollar now versus later.
			• Nominal vs. Real Rates
				– Nominal interest rates - typical market rates.
				– Real interest rates - interest rates adjusted for inflation.
				
			if pi is annual inflation rate,
				Real CF = Nominal CF/(1+pi)^t
				
				1+r_real = (1+r_nominal)/(1+pi)
				
		-> Foreign Currency:
			• How do we discount cashflows in foreign currencies?
			• Discounting rule
				– Discount each currency at its own interest rate: discount $’s at
				the U.S. interest rate, ₤’s at the U.K. interest rate, ….
				– This gives PV of each cashflow stream in its own currency.
				– Convert to domestic currency at the current exchange rate.
				
		-> Mortgage calculation
			• Pay 20% down payment, and borrow the rest from the bank using the
			property as collateral.
			• Pay a fixed monthly payment for the life of the mortgage.
			• Have the option to prepay the mortgage anytime before the maturity date
			of the mortgage.
			

# LEC 3

		-> Fixed-income securities:
			- A debt security is a financial security that is characterized by a principal
	amount (the amount borrowed), together with a plan for repayment of
	the principal plus interest.
			• Fixed-income securities are financial claims with promised cash flows of
			fixed amount paid at fixed dates.
			• Unlike a stock the payoffs for fixed income securities are fixed and known
			in advance.
			• Bond is a piece of paper is an IOU. It says, “I owe you” an amount known
			as principal at a prescribed future date (called the maturity date).
			• Bonds are less liquid. Bonds do not trade as frequently as equities and
			futures. Unlike stocks bonds are not traded on organized exchanges.
			
			- A coupon bond pays a sequence of cash flows typically semiannually,
quarterly, or annually till maturity. These are called coupon payments.
			• When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the bond’s
			par value (equivalently, its face value ).
			
			- When companies or other entities need to raise money to finance new projects, maintain ongoing operations, or refinance existing debts, they may issue bonds directly to investors.
			- The borrower (issuer) issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the time at which the loaned funds (bond principal) must be paid back (maturity date). 
			- The interest payment (the coupon) is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.
			
			- A bond have got a sequence of cash flows with
					 Maturity (normally ranging from 2 years to 30 years)
					 Principal: The principal of the bond, also called its face value or par value, refers to the amount of money the issuer agrees to pay the lender at the bond's expiration.
					 Coupon: A coupon or coupon paymentof is the annual interest rate paid on a bond, expressed as a percentage of the face value and paid from issue date until maturity. 
			
			- Face value, also known as the par value, is equal to the dollar amount the issuer pays to the investor at maturity. The price of a bond can fluctuate in the market by changes in interest rates while the face value remains fixed.

			• Pure Discount Bond
				- The most basic type of fixed-income security is a zero-coupon bond.
				This type of security make
					• No coupons, single payment of principal at maturity
					• Bond trades at a “discount” from the face value
				- Valuation of zero-coupon bonds is straightforward application of NPV.
				• The price of a discount bond is simply equal to its face value (F) discounted
				to the present by the appropriate interest rate.
												P0 = F/(1+r)^T
										, F is the face value of the bond, P0 is the price of the bond ( F is fixed )
										  T is the time till maturity
										  r is the discount/interest rate/yield.

		-> What if interest rates varies over time?
			-> Spot Interest Rate:
				- A single interest rate is used to discount all future cash flows that may change over time.
				- The spot rate is the rate of return earned by a bond when it is bought and sold on the secondary market without collecting interest payments
				– At spot rate we have to pay or that we will earn on the spot, ie., r0,T is
	for payments only on date T.
				– It is a multi-year rates
				
			-> Future Spot Rate (Short rate):
				– Short rate are the interest rate that prevails over a specific time period
				at some future date.
				– Short rates are always one-year rates.
				• R1 denotes the spot rate of interest between today and next year.
				R3 denotes the spot rate of interest between years 2 and 3.
				– In general, Rt is denoted as the one-year spot rate of interest
				between dates t‐1 and t.
				– Short rate provide us with the correct rate of discount to apply over a
				certain time period, e.g. the rate that prevailed between year one and
				year two.
			
			-> Spot rate and short rate relationship:
				• Spot rate r0,T is the “average” rate of interest between now and date T.
				• The one-year short rate, when accumulated by multiplying them together,
				will give the accumulated interest over the entire T-year period.
				- For example, the 2-year spot rate is an average of today’s short rate and
				next year’s short rate. But because of compounding, that average is a
				geometric one.
									=> P0 = F/(1 + r0,T) ^ T
										= F/(1+R1)(1+R2)...(1+RT)
										
			- But we don’t observe the entire sequence of future spot rates today!
			• What we observe is the price P0, F that we get from the marketplace and
			the bond contract
			- Today’s T-year spot rate is an “average” of one-year future spot rates
			- A plot of the r0,T as a function of time, is known as the term structure of interest rates or the yield curve
			
			-> Yield Curve:
				• Yield curve gives a sense of where future interest rates would be.
				- If the curve is upward-sloping, it says that as for longer maturities, average
	yield, the geometric average of all the R's is getting bigger with time.
				• In upward-sloping curve, the market's expectations are that the rates are
				going to go up.
				- If it's downward-sloping, it suggests that future interest rates, future R's, are declining.
				• The relationship between price and the r is inverse, means a low yield
				indicates price is really high.
				
			-> Valuation of Coupon Bonds
				• A coupon bond pays a stream of regular coupon payments and a principal
				at maturity
				• A bond with coupon payments C and a principal F at maturity T is composed of
					– C units of discount bonds maturing at t, t = 1, . . . , T
					– F units of discount bond maturing at T.
					
					so, price of the coupon bond:
					P0 = C/(1+R1) + C/(1+R1)(1+R2) + ... + (C+F)/(1+R1)(1+R2)...(1+RT)
				- Coupon bonds are often quoted with a single number that is a yield. Since
short rates are unobservable, we summarize them with y. this y is called the Yield-To-Maturity (YTM)
				- y is called the yield-to-maturity (YTM) of a bond. It is equal to the rate of return on the bond if
					• it is bought now at price P0 and held to maturity, and
					• all coupons are reinvested at rate y
						P0 = C/(1+y) + C/(1+y)^2 + ... + (C+F)/(1+y)^T
	


# LEC 4:
	Common Stock
		• Common stock represents equity, an ownership position, in a corporation.
		• There are two components of possible cash flows for a piece of equity
		security.
			1. Dividends:
				• Cash dividend: paying the shareholders through cash
				• Stock dividend: paying the shareholders through additional shares (distributing them)
				– Growth companies typically don't pay dividends. But they are valuable
				because of that capital gains or price appreciation.
			2. Capital gains or price appreciation
			
		Characteristics of common stock
			• The legal structure for equities is different than for bonds.
			1. Residual claim - stockholders have claim to firm’s cash flows/assets
			after all obligations to bondholders or creditors are met.
				– get access to all of the upside of a company's growth and
				success.
			2. Limited liability - stockholders may lose their investments, but no
			more.
				– equities have ability to provide proper motivation and
				incentives for innovation.
			3. Voting rights - stockholders are entitled to vote for the board of
directors and on other matters.
				– make sure that the board of directors, will take decision in
				the best interests of the shareholders.
			4. Access to public markets
				– power of the masses for development of innovation and
				capital formation, to co-invest.
			5.Ease of short sales -
				– short sell allows investors to get information into the market
				price as quickly and as easily as possible.

		-> Preferred stocks
			• Preferred stock is a form of equity that is usually issued in addition to
			common stock.
			• Preferred stocks typically pay fixed dividends, which makes them similar to
			other fixed-income securities such as bonds.
			• It is called preferred because its holders have priority over owners of
			common stock to receive dividends and to file property claims in
			bankruptcy liquidation.

		-> Dividend Discount Model
			It starts with the recognition that, when you invest in a company, you're
getting the rights to the flow of cash forever.
			• Not all stocks pay dividends, but eventually the stock will pay dividend at
			some point.
			– If a company is growing and it has value, then it will pay a dividend at
			some point. If a company never, ever pays dividends, then, it pays no
			cash forever, that seems like a very bad asset of worth 0.
			– If the company doesn't pay dividends and it gets liquidated, then
			shareholders get a pro rata share of whatever's in the company.
			
			Stock price is the value of sequence of future cash flows is simply equal to the
expectation today at time t, of future dividends paid out into the infinite future,
discounted back by the appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return.
basically, it is the discounted cash flows of future dividends.
			
			- Pt: Expected stock price at t
			-  Dt: Expected cash dividend at t
			- rt: Risk-adjusted (that is commensurate with the risks of the dividends)
			discount rate for cash flow at t.
			
			two sources of uncertainty for stockholders
				1. Discount rate: it's the risk-adjusted discount rate, and if risks change
				over time, the discount rate should change.
				2. Timing: company’s cash flows and market condition may change
				
			
			- In this case, we have the first version of the dividend discount model or the discounted cashflow (DCF) model. Stock price is the present values of future dividends.
			
			for constant dividend (growth=0):
				- two simplications: E_t[D_(t+k)] = D, r_(t+k) = r;
										P0 = D/(1+r) + D/(1+r)^2 + ... = D/r.
			
			- It's not the company that gets to determine the discount rate, but rather it's the company's riskiness-- or rather the riskiness of the cash flows and the market's assessment of the cost of that riskiness-- that determines the interest rate.
			
			- The price of common stock is an increasing function of the expected cash flows in the form of future dividends.
			- The price of a stock is inversely proportional to its discount rate. 
			
		-> DDM for Finite Holding Period:
			- Let stock price be P0 at t = 0. For one - year holding period, the discounted present value is equal to the sum of next period’ s dividend plus next period’ s stock price.
											P0 = (P1 + D1)/(1+r)
											P1 = (P2 + D2)/(1+r)
			- infinitely means we get the formula for infinite holding period. (normal DDM)
			- for dividends with growth, Di = (1 + g) * D_(i-1) = D_0 * (1 + g)^i
			
		-> GORDON GROWTH MODEL: (Constant growth DDM model)
			- basically dividends grow by some rate g over time, and stock is held for infinite duration.
								
								P_0 = D_0(1+g)/(1+r) + D_0(1+g)^2/(1+r)^2 + D_0(1+g)^3/(1+r)^3 + ...
									= D_0 (1+g)/(r-g)
									= D_1/(r-g), r>g.
									
								r = (D_0 (1+g) /P_0) + g
					- r = expected rate of return / discounted rate / interest rate.
					- g = growth rate per year
					- D/P= Dividend price ratio, or dividend yield
					- D0= the most recent or current dividend
			- The rate of return of the company is not just the dividend that gives a company value, it's the ability for companies to grow over time
			- The market determine the discount rate as well as the growth rate on the dividend.					
			- Suppose the interest rate r were less than g, so the rate at which assets in the future are being deflated to the present is actually less than the rate at what the wealth is growing. Which means that if it is continue into perpetuity, then in very short period the total wealth become bigger than the entire planet's GDP 
			– Hence, this growth rate is not sustainable, or, this formula doesn't
			work if r<g.
			- DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) with constant growth gives a relation between current stock price, current dividend, dividend growth rate and the expected return. Knowing three of the variables, we can determine the fourth.
			
		-> DCF with multiple growth stages:
			- Firms often evolve through different stages in their growth. For example, some may have three stages during their lifetime:
				1. Growth stage - rapidly expanding sales, high profit margins, and
				abnormally high growth in earnings per share, many new investment
				opportunities, low dividend payout ratio.
				2. Transition stage - growth rate and profit margin reduced by
				competition, fewer new investment opportunities, high payout ratio.
				3. Maturity stage - earnings growth, payout ratio and average return on
				equity stabilizes for the remaining life of the firm.
				
		-> Relative Valuation:
			- In relative valuation, the value of an asset is compared to the values
assessed by the market for similar or comparable assets.
			• Relative valuation can be completed with far fewer assumptions and far
			more quickly than a DCF valuation.
			• Relative valuation is much more likely to reflect market perceptions and
			moods than discounted cash flow valuation
			
			
		-> P/E ratio:
			• Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) can be estimated using company's current earnings per
share, or an expected earnings per share in the next year.
							P/E = Market Price per Share / company's Earnings per Share (EPS)
			• P/E ratio is referred to as “multiple” because it shows how much investors
			are willing to pay per dollar of earning. The P/E ratio actually is a reflection
			of the market’s optimism concerning a firm’s growth prospects
			• Consider Sturbucks’ 2020 end P/E of 43 compared with the P/E ratio of 7
for General Motors. These ratio tell us that investors expect Sturbucks’
earnings to grow much more rapidly than GM’s
			- A high P/E ratio can mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued.
A low P/E ratio might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings. 
			- Companies that grow faster than average, such as technology companies, typically have higher P/Es. A higher P/E ratio shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price now due to growth expectations in the future.
			• High P/E
				– Companies with a high P/E ratio are often considered to be growth
				stocks. This indicates a positive future performance, and investors
				have higher expectations for future earnings growth and are willing to
				pay more for them.
				– A high P/E ratio also could mean that a company's stock is over-valued
				and are expected to go low. This is because growth stock will
				eventually have to live up to the high rating by substantially increasing
				its earnings, or the stock price will need to drop.
			• Low P/E
				– Companies with a low P/E ratio are often considered to be value
				stocks. It means they are undervalued because their stock price
				trade lower relative to its earning fundamentals. This mispricing will
				be a great bargain and will prompt investors to buy the stock before
				the market corrects it.
			
			-> Valuation using P/E ratio for current EPS
										P0 = D1 / (r-g)
										   = D0 (1+g)/(r-g)
										
										P0/E0 = P/E ratio = (D0/E0) * (1+g) / (r-g)
											  = payout ratio * (1+g)/(r-g)
									
				- where payout ratio = D0/E0, Earnings= total profit net of depreciation and taxes currently
				
			-> Valution using P/E ratio for forward EPS
				
				- EPS_i = EPS_(i-1) * (1+g)
				- D1 = E1 ( 1-b ) (E1 is the forward EPS)
					b= Plowback ratio (also called retention ratio)= retained earnings/total earnings			 
					= ( earnings - dividends )/ earnings
					
				- Pay out ratio= dividend/earnings = DPS/EPS = p
					=> b = 1 - p
					=> P0 = D1 / r-g
						  = E1 (1-b)/(r-g)
					=> P/E = P0/E1 = (1-b)/(r-g) = (1-b) / (r- ROE * b)
					 		ROE= Return on book equity = Net Earnings /Book value of Equity
					 		
					 		

# LECTURE 8:
	- How a firm’s operations are financed is referred to as its capital structure.
	
	- Capital structure decision: Describing a firm’s capital structure is finding the right financing mix between the financing choices: Equity vs. Debt.
	
	- A firm’s capital structure is given by its debt to equity ratio.
	
	-> Equity financing:
		- Private firm: founders and others contribute money
		- Publicly-traded firm: shareholders contribute money in the initial
		public offering (IPO). Subsequently, more funds can be raised in a
		seasoned equity offering.
		- Retained earnings: shareholders money gets “plowed back in.”
		
	-> Debt financing:
		- Bank loans
		- Corporate bonds
		
	- The optimal capital structure that maximizes the value of the firm is also the one that minimizes the cost of capital.
	
	-> Financing Policy:
		• But what is the best source of funds?
			• Internal funds (i.e., cash)?
			• Debt (i.e., borrowing)?
			• Equity (i.e., issuing stock)?
			
		• Moreover, the policy depends on different kinds of sources
			• internal funds (e.g., cash reserves vs. cutting dividends)
			• debt (e.g., Banks vs. Bonds)
			• equity (e.g., VC vs. IPO)
	
	- Levered vs unlevered:
		– A company that has no debt is called an unlevered firm; a company
that has debt in its capital structure is a levered firm.

	# Modigliani-Miller (MM) Theorem:
		- The Modigliani-Miller theorem (M&M) states that the market value of a company is correctly calculated as the present value of its future earnings and its underlying assets and is independent of its capital structure. (Note: Capital structure is how a company funds its overall operations and growth.)
		
		- At its most basic level, the theorem argues that, with certain assumptions in place, it is irrelevant whether a company finances its growth by borrowing, by issuing stock shares, or by reinvesting its profits.
		
		- Companies have only three ways to raise money to finance their operations and fuel their growth and expansion. They can borrow money by issuing bonds or obtaining loans; they can re-invest their profits in their operations, or they can issue new stock shares to investors. The Modigliani-Miller theorem argues that the option or combination of options that a company chooses has no effect on its real market value.
					
		- Implications of Proposition I:
			1. A firm’s capital structure is irrelevant.
			2. A firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the same no matter what mixture of debt and equity is used to finance the firm.

		- Implications of Proposition II:
			1. The cost of equity rises as the firm increases its use of debt financing.
			2. The risk of the equity depends on two things: the riskiness of the firm’s operations (business risk) and the degree of financial leverage (financial risk).
			
												re = ra + (ra - rd) D/E
												
		• Do real-world managers follow MM by treating capital structure decisions
with indifference?
		• Unfortunately, virtually all companies in certain industries, such as
		banking, choose high debt-equity ratios.
		• Conversely, companies in other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chose
		low debt-equity ratios.
		• In fact, almost any industry has a debt-equity ratio to which companies in
		that industry tend to adhere.
		• Thus companies do not appear to be selecting there degree of leverage in
		a random manner.						
		
	-> Capital Structure and Corporate Taxes
		• Managers pay great attention to the tax implications of their financial
		decisions.
		• Financial transactions are taxed (e.g. taxes on capital gains, dividends, etc.)
		• Different financial transactions are taxed differently:
			– Interest payments are considered a business expense, and tax exempt
		for the firm.
			– Dividends and retained earnings are taxed.
			– In Indian system, capital gain tax is less than dividend tax.
		• Why interest expenses is tax deductible?
			– It is an incentive, subsidy to encourage entrepreneurs, employers etc.
		• Other things equal, the firm’s financing decision might aim at minimizing
		its tax burden.						
		
		- Claim: Issuing debt saves taxes and increases a firm’s value.
		
	# Modigliani-Miller Proposition with tax case
		- Modigliani-Miller Proposition I with Taxes
			• The values of two firms in the same risk class will differ by the present
			value of their tax shield.
			VL = VU +PV (debt tax-shield)
			
		- Modigliani-Miller Proposition II with Taxes
			• The WACC declines as the debt-equity ratio grows
