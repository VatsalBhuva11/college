- we can run our custom sh files from any directory by adding the PATH to the directory of the shell file to the
~/.bashrc file. we also have to give execution access to the users by chmoding.
eg: chmod u+x hello.sh
	export PATH=$PATH:"/home/vbuntu/Desktop/Vatsal/college/Sem 3/OS/lab_assignments"
	
- set proxy for running apt commands in /etc/apt/apt.conf ("Acquire ...")


#FORK
- fork() system call creates a child process from the current parent process. using n forks, we can have a total of 2^n processes (2^n - 1 child processes, 1 parent process). using fork() on P creates a C, but P also remains. so only one child created per fork, per parent.

- The child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, and same open files which use in the parent process. It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. OS allocates different data and states for these two processes, and the control flow of these processes can be different. So, the variable values remain independent across forks.
