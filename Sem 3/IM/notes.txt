# LEC 1:
	-> What is Marketing?

		- Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.
		
	-> What is Marketing Management?

		- Marketing management is the art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing customers through creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value.
		
	-> Needs, Wants, and Demands

		- Need: State of felt deprivation including physical, social, and individual needs.
			➢ Physical needs: Food, clothing, shelter, safety
			➢ Social needs: Belonging, affection
			➢ Individual needs: Learning, knowledge, self-expression
			
		- Want: Form that a human need takes, as shaped by culture and individual personality.
											Wants + Buying Power = Demand
								
	-> Types of Needs (SURDS)
		➢Stated needs, e.g. the customer wants an inexpensive car.
		➢Unstated needs, e.g. the customer expects good service from the dealer.
		➢Real needs, e.g. the customer wants a car whose operating cost, not its initial price, is low.
		➢Delight needs, e.g. the customer would like the dealer to include an onboard navigation system.
		➢Secret needs, e.g. the customer wants to be seen by friends as a savvy consumer.
		
	-> Types of Demands (Demand States and Marketing Tasks)
		➢ Negative demand → counter marketing, e.g. insurance.
		➢ Non-existent demand → stimulus, e.g. encyclopedias.
		➢ Latent demand → developing, e.g. solar energy, Kindle.
		➢ Declining demand → remarketing, e.g. Arm & Hammer and Listerine
		➢ Irregular demand → synchro marketing e.g. seasonal products (raincoat, umbrella)
		
	-> Phases of Marketing
		➢ The production concept:
			➢The idea that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive.
			➢Focus: high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution.
			➢It is useful when (1) the demand for a product exceeds the supply (e.g., developing countries such as China); (2) the product’s cost is too high.
			
		➢ The product concept:
			➢The idea that consumers will prefer products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features.
			➢Focus: making superior products and improving them over time.
			➢Examples: digital camera, CPU.
			
		➢ The selling concept:
			➢The idea that consumers will not buy enough of the firm’s products unless it undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion effort.
			➢Focus: undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort.
			➢Practiced most aggressively with unsought goods (e.g., insurance).
			
		➢ The marketing concept:
			➢The idea that the key to achieving organizational goals consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value to its chosen target markets.
			➢Three hurdles: organized resistance, slow learning, and fast forgetting.
			
			-> The Societal Marketing Concept
				➢The idea that holds that a company should make good marketing
				decisions by considering consumers’ wants, the company’s
				requirements, consumers’ long-run interests, and society’s long-run
				interests.

		➢ The holistic marketing concept:
			- Holistic marketing concept considers all the different parts of a business as one single entity. It is based on the premise that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As such, there is a shared aim and purpose for all the activities related to a business
			- Holistic marketing is a marketing strategy that connects all the different marketing channels and departments of a company.
			
	-> Customer Markets:
		➢The consumer market is made up of all the people who make decisions about what to buy and what not to buy.
		➢Everyone who buys products or services is a consumer.
		➢‘Market’ has a special meaning – relating to the likely demand for aproduct or service.
		➢Over time the size of the population of a particular country may not change dramatically, so the consumer market is fixed in size.
		
	-> Types of Customer Markets:
		➢Consumer markets:
			➢ Companies selling mass consumer goods and services such as juices, cosmetics, athletic shoes, and air travel
			➢ spend a great deal of time establishing a strong brand image by developing a superior product and packaging, ensuring its availability, and backing it with engaging communications and reliable service.

		➢Business markets:
			➢It allows them to sell products or services to other companies or organizations that resell them, use them in their products or services, or use them to support their works.
			➢Companies selling business goods and services often face well-informed professional buyers skilled at evaluating competitive offerings.
			➢Business buyers buy goods to make or resell a product to others at a profit. Business marketers must demonstrate how their products will help achieve higher revenue or lower costs.
			➢Advertising can play a role, but the sales force, the price, and the company’s reputation may play a greater one.

		➢Global markets:
			- Companies in the global marketplace must decide which countries to enter;
			➢ how to enter each (as an exporter, licenser, joint venture partner, contract manufacturer, or solo manufacturer);
			➢ how to adapt product and service features to each country; how to price products in different countries; and
			➢ how to design communications for different cultures.
			➢ They face different requirements for buying and disposing of property; cultural, language, legal and political differences; and currency fluctuations. Yet, the payoff can be huge.
			
			
# LEC 2:
	- STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)
	1. Choose which customer to serve
		– Market Segmentation (Parts of market)
		– Targeting (Segments to enter)
	2. Decide how to serve those customers
		– Product differentiation (what makes it difference from the competition)
		– Marketing Positioning (how customers perceive the product)
		
	• Segmenting:
		– Grouping customers by some criteria
		
		• Grouping prospective buyers into different segments based on shared characteristics.
		
		• It involves segmenting a heterogeneous market into a number of smaller homogeneous markets based on different customer characteristics that play a role in determining their wants and purchasing decisions.

		- Reasons for segmenting the market:
			➢Understanding customers’ need
			➢Targeted marketing communication
			➢Efficient use of resources
			➢Competitive advantage		
			
		- 4 types of segmentation:
			a) Geographic: countries, states, cities, villages, urban / rural, climatic conditions, density of population.
				- market is divided on the basis of regions or geographies.
				- helps to reach out to customers living in a similar region or area and have identical needs.
				- choose to sell only in rural areas or villages
				- seasonal products like umbrellas where it rains more
				- FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) products in regions of high density of population
				
			b) Demographic: Age, Life Cycle, Gender, Income, Marital Status, Occupation
				• Consumer preferences continually change with age.
				• Almost all marketing campaigns target age-specific audiences.
				• Babies, children, adolescents, adults, middle-age, and seniors.
				• Age segmentation can also be generation-based :
					- Gen X (1960s to 1980s)
					- Gen Y (1980s to 2000s)
					- Gen Z (After 2000)
					- Gen Alpha (Early 2010s)
				• If married or not
				• Certain products are gender-specific (like male-deodorants, footwear, clothing)
				• Income, ofcourse, if high-end product like expensive cars.
				• Students, Businessmen, Retailers, Stock Traders specific
				
			c) Psychographic:
				• Psychographic segmentation is one which uses people's lifestyle, their activities, interests as well as opinions to define a market segment.
					– Lifestyle: Everyone has different clothing habits based on their lifestyle.The customer might be school going, college going, office going or other.
					– Activities, Interest and Opinion: Different customers might have different activities and interests.
					– Social Class: Different consumers fall in different social classes.
					
			d) Behavioral: Heavy user, Light user, Occasion oriented
				1. Occasion oriented: When a product is used or purchased for a particular occasion only.
				2. Usage oriented: The grouping can be on the basis of how much a product is being used/consumed by the customer. Accordingly, we call them heavy user or light user groups.
				3. Loyalty oriented: retention rates of the consumers
				4. Benefits sought: Consumer segmentation is also done on the basis of the different benefits perceived by different consumers.
				
				
	• Targeting:
		- Choosing which group(s) to sell
		- After dividing the market into different segments, the company decide what all segments could be beneficial for them and are easy to penetrate.
		- involves evaluatiing:
			– Segment size and growth
			– Segment structural attractiveness
				• Level of competition in each segment
				• Substitute products
				• Power of buyers
				• Powerful suppliers
			– Company objectives and resources
			
		- based on scope of segment targeted, we have:
					undifferentiated -> differentiated -> concentrated -> micromarketing
					(broad marketing)				-> 					(narrow marketing)
	

# LEC 3:
	- What is Brand Positioning? What space does the brand occupy in the mind of consumers with respect to competition?
	- What consumers think about your brand / product?
	- What all strong brands have in common is that they have a distinct brand positioning.
	-> Brand Positioning
		• No company can win if its products / services resemble every other product and offering.
		• Each offering must represent the right kinds of things in the minds of the target market
		
	-> Positioning and value proposition
		• Positioning is the act of designing a company’s offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of the target market.
		• Value proposition: what are the primary benefits from buying the offering that our company offers?
			– Functional benefits
			– Monetary benefits
			– Psychological benefits
			– Holistic combination of the above
			
	-> Brand Substition Test to check how good the positioning is:
		- With the brand substitution test, you can test a marketing campaign (like an online banner, a promo video, a poster, a billboard).
			a) Simply replace your brand with the brand of a competitor.
			b) If the marketing campaign does not work, it’s a strong brand positioning.
			c) Successful brands are distinctive.
		- basically checking if our USPs are actually USPs, and our campaign is unique from that of a competitor
		
	-> Analyzing Competitors:
		- In each market and every niche, there will be competitors with whom you’ll have to compete. That’s why you need to study your competitors. It’s almost impossible to win the competition if you don’t know who you are competing with.
		- Only if you are aware of your competitors, you can analyze them and develop effective market positioning strategies to gain market shares from them.
		- Brands which may come into question could be brands which offer products:
			a) like your product (within the same product category) or
			b) that could substitute your product.
		- Gather information about each competitor’s real and perceived strengths and weaknesses
	
	-> PoD (Points of Difference):
		- Your points of difference are FAVORABLE and UNIQUE attributes that consumers:
			a) evaluate positively,
			b) strongly associate with your brand, and
			c) cannot find in a different brand.
		- Any type of attribute can be a point of difference, and strong brands usually have multiple of them.
		- These are three proven criteria to identify relevant points of difference:
			1) Desirable to consumers: your brand must be relevant to consumers, so you must give them a reason to believe why they need an attribute
			2) Deliverable by the company: you need to give consumers a reason why your business can deliver the desired benefit
			3) Differentiating from competitors: attributes must be different and superior to relevant competitors

	-> PoP (Points of Parity):
		- In each product category, there are particular attributes that a product has to have.
		- That’s why it’s not only essential to establish differentiating points of difference, but equally important to match the competition on vital points of parity.
		- Points of parity are attributes that are considered mandatory for a product category. Without these attributes, a brand would lack critical functions. So you may share them with competitors.
		
	-> Positioning statement:
		- A positioning statement is a brief description of a product or service and an explanation of how it fulfills a particular need of the target market. (usually a slogan for the brand)
		- The goal of a positioning statement is to align marketing efforts with a company's brand and value proposition.
		- get crystal clear on a few key facets of your business:
			– Who you serve
			– What value you offer
			– How you position your offer
			– How you communicate your offer
			– Why you're in business
			– What makes you different from the competition
		- use several parameters to establish brand position:
			1) Category of product
			2) Target customer/segment
			3) Competition
			4) Key differentiator/USP
			5) Communicating to customers the brand position and the idea behind the brand.
			
			
# LEC 4:
	-> Marketing Mix
		- Set of strategies/tactics/activities companies undertake to promote its product or brand inthe market.

		-> Elements of marketing mix
			• McCarthy classified various marketing activities into marketing-mix tools
			• The four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion
		
		1) PRODUCT:
			• An idea, a physical entity (a good), a service, or any combination of them which aims to satisfy individual or business objectives .
			• Anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption and that might satisfy a want or need.
				– Includes physical objects, services, events, persons, places, organizations, ideas or some combination thereof.
				
			-> Maslow's Hierarchy of needs
				1) Self-actualization
				2) Esteem
				3) Love and belonging
				4) Safety needs
				5) Physiological needs
			
			-> Types of products:
				1) Consumer goods: Consumed by people, final users of the product
				2) Consumer services: Services for final users (eg: restaurants)
				3) Producer goods: Goods produced for other businesses to use
				4) Producer services: Services for other businesses (eg: lawyers)
				
			-> Levels of products:
				1) Core Benefit:
					• The core benefit is the fundamental need that the customer satisfies when they buy the product.
					• It is important to think of the core benefit from the customersperspective. The easiest way to do this is to ask yourself, “Fundamentally, why is the customer buying this product?”.
					• For example, the core benefit of a mobile phone is to provide amechanism to make telephone calls when away from your home or office.
					• Note that products are rarely marketed using the core product. This is because core products offer no competitive advantage. but these benefits are what really define the use of the product. marketing is done on what is added onto these basic features
					
				2) Actual Product:
					• The actual product is the product features and its design. Products typically have lots of features but very few actual benefits (core benefits) to the customer.
					• Returning to our mobile phone example, then the actual product consists of the design and features of the phone, including:
						–Dimensions.
						–Color.
						–Screen size.
						–Bluetooth compatibility.
						–App ecosystem size.
						–Packaging.
						
				3) Augmented Product/Supplementary Services:

			-> Product vs Brand:
				- Product is made in factory, brand is something who's products are purchased
				- Product can be copied, brand is unique
				- Product can get outdated, successfully brand is timeless.
				
		2) PRICE:
			- Price is the amount of money charged for a product or service.
				• The sum of all the values that consumers give up in order to gain the benefits of having or using a product or service.

			• Price is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; all other elements represent costs.
			• Discounts
			• Allowances
			• Credit Terms and Payment Periods
			
			a) Add up your variable costs (per product)
			b) Add a profit margin
			c) Don't forget about fixed costs (like machines, equipment)
					
		3) PLACE:
			• How can a business ensure that its products reach existing and potential customers?
			• How and where do customers prefer to buy the product?
			• How important are factors such as stock availability, price, speed?
			
			• Objective of distribution
				–To make products available in the right place at the right time in the right quantities
			• Distribution Channel
				–A distribution channel moves a product from production to consumption
			
			-> Levels in distribution channel:
				- each party in a distribution channel is called an "intermediary"
				1) Producer -> Customer
				2) Producer -> Distributor/Agents
				3) Producer -> Wholesaler -> Retailer -> Customer
				
		4) PROMOTION:
			• Promotion is a marketing activity used to communicate with customers and potential customers to inform and persuade them to buy a business’s products.
			• The aim of promotion is to create awareness, create interest , generate sales or create brand loyalty.
				– Increase sales and market share
				– Create brand image
				– Introduce new products to the market

			-> Two types of promotion:
				a) Advertising:
					• Informative advertising – give audience detailed information about a product. (like low-calory packed food available)
					• Persuasive advertising – Tries to persuade audience that they need a product. (like the need to buy a mosquito racket in times of dengue)
					• Social media, Radio (FM), Newspaper, Specialised Magazines, Billboards, TV, You tube, Public Events, Event Sponsorships and Appearances
					
				b) Sales Promotion:
					• Price Reduction – Reduce the price to attract more customers 
					• Gifts (shops that offer gift packaging on purchase)
					• Products that comes with entry to a competition such as winning a prize. (like win a mobile in lottery)
					• Point of sales (POS) display for demonstration (like displaying mobile phones in electronic shop)
					• Free samples (like free samples of yoghurt in mall)
					
		-> 7 Ps of Service Marketing:
			• Product
			• Place

		• A company’s positioning and differentiation strategy must change as its product, market, and competitors change over the PLC.
		
		-> Stages in PLC:
			1. Introduction—A period of slow sales growth as the product is introduced in the market. Profits are nonexistent because of the heavy expenses of product introduction.
				– establish a clear brand identity
				– connect with the right partners to promote your product
				– set up consumer tests, or provide samples or trials to key target markets
				– price the product or service as high as you believe you can sell it, and to reflect the quality level you are providing
				
			2. Growth—A period of rapid market acceptance and substantial profit improvement.
				– mainly to improve profits
				– improving product quality
				– adding new product features or support services to grow your market share
				– entering new markets segments
				– keeping pricing as high as is reasonable to keep demand and profits high
				– increasing distribution channels to cope with growing demand
				– shifting marketing messages from product awareness to product preference
				– skimming product prices if your profits are too low
					- Price skimming is a pricing strategy in which a firm charges a high initial price and then gradually lowers the price to attract more price-sensitive customers
					- This approach contrasts with the penetration pricing model, which focuses on releasing a lower-priced product to grab as much market share as possible.
					
			3. Maturity—A slowdown in sales growth because the product has achieved acceptance by most potential buyers. Profits stabilize or decline because of increased competition.
				• When your sales peak, your product will enter the maturity stage.
				• This often means that your market will be saturated, and you may find that you need to change your marketing tactics to prolong the life cycle of your product.
				• Common strategies that can help during this stage fall under one
				of two categories:
					– market modification - this includes entering new market segments, redefining target markets, winning over competitor's customers, converting non-users
					– product modification - for example, adjusting or improving your product's features, quality, pricing and differentiating it from other products in the marking
			
			4. Decline—Sales show a downward drift and profits erode.
				• Declining sales and profits.
				• This can be caused by changes in consumer preferences, technological advances and alternatives on the market.
					– Harvesting strategy: reduction or a termination of investments in a product, product line
					– Let the product die its own death
					– Find another use for the product

		• Inseparability – For most services, the production and consumption of the service occur simultaneously.
		• Variability – It is hard for a service organization to standardize the quality of its service performance.
		• Perishability – Most services cannot be produced or stored before consumption. They exist only at the time of their production.

			1) People processing: (eg. Haircut, Healthcare)
				- Customers must:
					- physically enter the service factory
					- co-operate actively with the service operation
					- Managers should think about process and output from customer’s perspective
					
			2) Possession processing: (eg. Fuel refuelling, recycling)
				- Customers are less physically involved compared to people processing services
				- Involvement is limited
				- Production and consumption are separable
				
			3) Mental stimulus processing: (eg: Education)
				- Ethical standards required when customers who depend on such services can potentially be manipulated by suppliers
				- Physical presence of recipients not required
				- Core content of services is information-based
				
			4) Information processing: (eg: Accounting, Banking)

		1) Sorting: The middlemen collect goods from various sources. These goods are different in quality, size, nature, colour etc. These goods are then sorted based on their features.
		2) Accumulation: This function involves accumulation of goods into larger homogeneous stocks, which maintain continuous flow of supply. Basically adding more products into the sorted groups is called accumulation.
		3) Allocation: Allocation involves breaking homogeneous stock into smaller marketable lots.
		4) Assorting: Middlemen procure variety of goods from different sources and deliver them in combinations desired by the customers.
		5) Product promotion: The middlemen advertise the product kept with them. They also do certain sales promotion activities like demonstrations; special displays etc. to increase the sale of products.

				- In this type, the intermediary is the retailer firm directly supplies the product to retailer who sells the product directly to customers. Eg: Maruti Udyog sells its cars through company approved retailers
				
			2.Two level channels:

			3.Three level channels:
